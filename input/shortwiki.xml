{{Basic forms of government}}

'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often descri
bed as [[stateless society|stateless societies]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ANARCHISM, a s
ocial philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that volunt
ary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.&quo
t; George Woodcock. &quot;Anarchism&quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/
ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary ass
ociations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity woul
d take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in
 all its functions.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotki

Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both p
ossible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, Lon

defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&lt;ref&
gt;&quot;as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that the
y find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with t

oy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the 
abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hiera
rchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to m
aintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human
 or animal society can exist.&quot; [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarc

y use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocat
ive. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more wide
spread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce
 a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class
, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscu
rantist. This practice, in the name of a &quot;classless&quot; or &quot;libertar
ian&quot; society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationsh
ips and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economi
c exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.&quot; 
[[Murray Bookchin]]. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of 
Hierarchy. CHESHIRE BOOKS

ms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the &quot;sociology o
f power&quot;) and the correlative duty to obey (as explored in the &quot;philos
ophy of practical reason&quot;). Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by
 its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims 
made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &quo
t;authoritative&quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are the
refore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&quot;[http://books.googl

 real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free acce

t;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposi
tion to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the 
right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liber
ty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socia
lism and Anarchism&amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speak
ing, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor he
r both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sinc
erely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as
 a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subs
erve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of t
he world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her
 only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging
 her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere
 of thought and human activity.  representatives of the first are seen in the Ca
tholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church
 and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in t
he atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]]

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}

The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' is a compound word composed from the w

Yangists,&quot; chapters 8 to 11, and 28 to 31. These thinkers appear to have be
en profoundly influenced by the Laozi, and also by the thought of the first and 
last of the Inner Chapters: &quot;Wandering Beyond,&quot; and &quot;Responding t
o Emperors and Kings.&quot; There are also possible signs of influence from Yang
 Zhu, whose concern was to protect and cultivate one's inner life-source. These 
chapters combine the anarchistic ideals of a simple life close to nature that ca

uring of life. &quot; [http://www.iep.utm.edu/zhuangzi/ &quot;Zhuangzi (Chuang-T

The French [[Renaissance humanism|renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] wrote in his most famous work the ''Discourse on Voluntary Servit
ude'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.&lt;ref&gt;
Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie's treat
ise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La botie never extended his an
alysis from tyrannical government to government per se. But while La Botie canno
t be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the univers
ality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion.[h

such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the [[Levellers]] and the Ranters, there emerged
 perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19
th-century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed t
hat a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishme

 &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Pro
udhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecesso
rs outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first 
was Gerrard Winstanley (1609 – c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small moveme
nt of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers proteste
d in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that follo
wed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model 
Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches
 of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on
 work on the land and the sharing of goods.&quot; George Woodcock Anarchism The

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 198

, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread o
f the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither aw
ay as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legi
timacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the governm
ent from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of pe

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as 
a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic 
foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to
 use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of soci
al organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to cons
train the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full
 and free exercise of private judgment.

The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first ''self-proclaimed
'' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, ''[[What is Property?]],'' published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the
 founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From 
Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He deve
loped the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges
 without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills 
of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is,
 &quot;Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.&quot; In ''What is Pro
perty?'' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]]
.&quot; In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot;
 (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot;
 their property as they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/refe

ion,&quot; or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or les
s continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that &quot;Property is Liberty,
&quot; and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards,

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (m
ore formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an up
rising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists
 participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included 
[[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murder
ed in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, s
uch as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their i
deas of associated labour beginning to be realised&amp;nbsp;... Moreover, the Co
mmune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a 
communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates 
issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's an
d Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;im
plementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848&amp;nbsp;... and for federatio
n of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was hea

ing the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, th
e [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relat
ion between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and
 Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter
 thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a
 [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself s

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the
 first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations wer

efore the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics,

gt; By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use 
the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, 
[[regicide]]s, and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts

he most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced 
themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year i
n ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be 
destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, Ja
mes H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' Ne
w Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocate
d the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionar
y action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed 
anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could d
o very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''
[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labour movement]]s following the f
ew successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonmen
t of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the firs
t place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the
 French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression 
of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'
' to [[penal colonies]], favoured individualist political expression and acts.&l
t;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I
n March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two mo
nths. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one
 horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, 
a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s 
'[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deport
ed to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, I
taly, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that rule
d out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a gen
eral amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic
 found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many o
f France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. T
he ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in a
lienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for 
its victims at home and abroad.&quot; {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first =

=== Spanish Revolution ===
{{Main article|Spanish Revolution}}
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and 
abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, 
the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front ba
ck to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted c
oup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

osing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who control
led much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. According to [[Noam Chomsky]], &quot;the communists were mainly 
responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia
—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists
 basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and 
were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because Stalin still hoped a
t that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Hitler. Tha
t, of course, failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even 
withdrew the Spanish gold reserves.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://thehumanist.com/mag

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&g

The revolutionary industrial unionist 
[[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 3,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First

===Classical anarchist schools of thought===

====Mutualism====
{{Main article|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before takin
g an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and oth
ers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The M
utualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has bee
n attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for 
Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; Shawn Wilburn, 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 
&quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anar
chy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only w
hat he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. 
H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;bu
siness transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

s just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial func
tions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone
 produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proud
hon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance
. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concer
ning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in Fren
ch parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist fa
ctions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected chart
ers for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes duri
ng his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and curr
ency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], 
each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for h
is work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent 
in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutu
alism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. 
(Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the
 mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work
; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost
, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then ge
t over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general
 prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&

etween individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul

ty, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proud

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main article|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarc
hist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions
, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean
 by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradit
ion, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;

ualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do 
not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his
 sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Li
berty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&qu
ot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individua
list anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualist
ic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 
1982. p. 115&quot;/&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&

ref&gt; [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) was an important early influence in 
individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an 
American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil governmen
t in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirne
r's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential
 publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

====Social anarchism====
{{Main article|Social anarchism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production
 and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority o
r [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quo
t;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is u
ncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have
 argued
 that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism
 of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individu
al very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens&amp;nbsp;... the way for rec
onstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot;
 [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist 
anarchism capitalistic?] ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism r
ejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retai

te ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be co
llectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting 
with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or ''[[propaganda by the deed]]'', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly colle
ctivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, 
as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods b
eing distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This pos
ition was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing

=====Anarcho-syndicalism=====
{{Main article|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|May day demonstration of Spanish 
[[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] i
n [[Bilbao]], Basque Country in 2010]]Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchi
sm that focuses on the [[trade union|labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges
. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-s
yndicalists view [[trade union|labour unions]] as a potential force for revoluti
onary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with 
a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of an
archo-syndicalism are: Workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]]
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]] – that is, action conce
ntrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as ele
cting a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate
 themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice
' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that 
workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system,
 which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new s
ociety) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business a
gents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that a
ffect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in t
he anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the moveme
nt, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938
 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is 
an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from di
fferent countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and
 still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labour movement]]. It was also an imp
ortant force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combi

[[decentralised]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]
]. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essentia
l part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary
 component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that &
quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of po
wer, it is inherently feminist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarc
ha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchis

Libertarian’ and ‘libertarianism’ are frequently employed by anarchists as synon
yms for ‘anarchist’ and ‘anarchism’, largely as an attempt to distance themselve
s from the negative connotations of ‘anarchy’ and its derivatives. The situation
 has been vastly complicated in recent decades with the rise of anarcho-capitali
sm, ‘minimal statism’ and an extreme right-wing laissez-faire philosophy advocat
ed by such theorists as Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick and their adoption of 
the words ‘libertarian’ and ‘libertarianism’. It has therefore now become necess
ary to distinguish between their [[right libertarianism]] and the [[left libertarianism]] of the anarchist tradition.&quot; ''[[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow: Left-Libertarian Thought and British Writers from William Morris to Colin Ward]]'' by David Goodway.

&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Within Libertarianism, Rothbard represents a minority persp
ective that actually argues for the total elimination of the state. However Roth
bard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wan
ts an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, 
with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purcha
sing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-sta
tism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, 
the “anarchy” of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.[http://theanarchistl

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies a
nd schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology 
and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarc
hism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with 
ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be
 motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethi
cal doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and s
imultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarc
hists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), some contemporary an
archists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], 
[[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring 
about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarch
ists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Hond
erich, Carmen García Trevijano, [https://books.google.com/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&

narchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anar

==Topics of interest==
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics 
of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

 those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and o

 established.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Where utopian projectors starting with [[Plato]] e
ntertained the idea of creating an ideal species through eugenics and education

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individua
l politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A
 number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist public
ation) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individuali
st anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time
, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought 
/ free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;m

mmerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Britis
h anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that &quot;A.
S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of &quot;hearts not 
heads in the school&quot;. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be 
hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recogn
ising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revo
lutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; [

 Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideol
ogies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, althou
gh Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in p
rinciple from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http:

In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchist
s have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]]
 was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institutio
n is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a con
sumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Des

== Criticisms ==
{{Main article|Criticisms of anarchism}}
Criticisms of anarchism include [[morality|moral]] criticisms and pragmatic crit
icisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics
. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book ''European Socialism'' a
rgued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a &quot;lesser
 evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He also argued 
that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an 
&quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, Carl. ''European Socialism: A History
 of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academy Award for Best Production Design''' recognizes achievement for [[art direction]] in [[art director#In film|film]]. The category's original name w
as '''Best Art Direction''', but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the
 85th Academy Awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http

t; This change resulted from the Art Director's branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) being renamed the Designer's branch. Since
 1947, the award is shared with the set decorator(s). It is awarded to the best 
interior design in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.c

seconds ahead of UTC. The 36 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 s
econds at the start of 1972, plus 26 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.

TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over fro
m non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, b
oth [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form w
as synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two ha
ve drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

==Operation==

TAI as a time scale is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 400 [[atomic clock]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iag.dgfi.badw.de/fileadmin/IAG-docs

 laboratories worldwide.{{sfn|Time|n.d.}} The clocks are compared using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency tra
nsfer]].&lt;ref&gt;Circular T 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the [[signal averaging]]
 it is far more stable than any clock would be alone. The majority of the clocks
 are [[Atomic clock|caesium clocks]]; the definition of the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[second]] is written in terms of [[caesium]].&lt;ref&gt;McCart
hy &amp;Seidelmann 2009, 207, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

The participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], 
a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time cod
es are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-kn
own integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form ''UTC(
NPL)'' in the UTC form, where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted ''TAI(NPL)''.  The latter i
s not to be confused with ''TA(NPL)'', which denotes an independent atomic time 
scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other. 
 The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines t
hese measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms t
he most stable time scale possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Time&quot; n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/pu
blication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[Canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This 
time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(''k'') (equ
ivalent to TAI-TAI(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.  (The same 
circular also gives tables of TAI-TA(''k''), for the various unsynchronised atom
ic time scales.)

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circu
lar T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published 
in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to disc
over errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale. 
 Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be
 creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

==History==
Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated 
by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atom
ic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium 
atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. The &quot;Greenwich Atomic&quot; (GA) scale began 
in 1955 at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or AM, in July 1955, using
 both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of 
[[VLF]] radio signals. The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 sca
le  13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by 
the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, [[Boulder, Colorado]].   Bo
th the BIH scale and A.1 were defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at 
the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 
00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. The procedures used by the BIH e
volved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;A3&quot; in 1963 and &quo
t;TA(BIH)&quot; in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 199&amp;ndash
;201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as i
t did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as
 published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the 
name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI se
conds with no leap seconds.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 202&amp;nd
ash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were dete
cted and corrected. In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to
 operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;William M
arkowitz. &quot;Nondependence of Frequency on Mass: A Differential Experiment&qu
ot; [[doi:10.1126/science.162.3860.1387]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking 
at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI 
scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clock
s.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections w
ere applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would corresp
ond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had be
en on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about on
e part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be publish
ed, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Sc
ale'').&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as th
e epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT), which represent three fundamental time s
cales in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg V.A. &amp; Kopeikin S.M., &quot;Re
lativistic time scales in the solar system&quot;, Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astron., Vol. 
48, pp. 23 - 44, 1990 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990CeMDA..48...23B&lt;/ref&
gt;  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 J
anuary 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide co
ntinuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation o
f TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &a
mp; Seidelmann, 218&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to 
the ITU-R which stated &quot;In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap s
econds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, a
s it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web

UTC is a [[discontinuous]] (i.e. regularly adjusted by leap seconds) time scale 
composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time. From its 
beginning in 1961 through December 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in f
ractional leap seconds so that UTC approximated [[UT2]].  Afterwards these adjus
tments were made only in whole seconds to approximate [[UT1]].  This was a compr
omise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale; the post-1
971 more linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scal
e would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally. The fact that 
it continues to approximate UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which re
quire a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by the public broadc
ast of UTC.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 227&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&g
